# lab11
The start of the final project

# Given Instructions
The Final Project is about a simulator for a very simple computer with a CPU that only has 2 registers, a small number of instructions, and a small amount of memory.

There are currently 14 instructions but some of them work in more than one way because of various addressing modes.

Step 1, Implement and Test ParityCheckException with Instruction

Step 2, Add "instructions" in the class Instruction 

Step 3, Make a class Machine

Step 4, Add Instructions to ACTION in Machine's constructor using lambda expressions

Step 5, Get the BasicTester from github and compare the Results file.
